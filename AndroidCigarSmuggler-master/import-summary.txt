ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* .gitignore
* build.properties
* build.xml
* default.properties
* extras/
* extras/designs/
* extras/designs/maps.psd
* proguard-config.txt
* proguard-obfuscation.xml
* tests/
* tests/com/
* tests/com/gamecook/
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/AbstractGameTest.java
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/collections/
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/collections/InventoryTest.java
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/collections/LocationsTest.java
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/collections/StoreTest.java
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/commerce/
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/commerce/BankTest.java
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/commerce/WalletTest.java
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/items/
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/items/AbstractItemTest.java
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/items/MockItem.java
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/managers/
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/managers/SingletonManagerTest.java
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/player/
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/player/PlayerTest.java
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/time/
* tests/com/gamecook/fit/time/CalendarTest.java

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* libs/OpenFeint.jar => app/libs/OpenFeint.jar
* libs/junit-4.8.2.jar => app/libs/junit-4.8.2.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
